# Path-Finding-Algorithms-Demo
WPF app for demonstrating shortest path finding algorithms.
## Pathfinding algorithms:
* A*
* Breadth First Search
* Dijkstra
* Greedy Best First Search
## Controls
* `Left click` - place nodes of selected type
* `Right click` - place starting point of the path
* Path destination point sets to `mouse cursor's` position
* To create shortest path - don't move the mouse for a little while
* `Alt` - hold position of destination point
* `"Generate map"` button - creates randomized field structure using cellular automata algorithm
* Select step-by-step operating mode to see the process of shortest path finding
